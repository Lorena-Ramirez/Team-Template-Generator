# Team-Template-Generator
## Description
  ---
  This application is dependent on Node CLI and uses the command line to take in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
  
  The application will then use that data to create an html file that displays all the data retireved from the user. While creating this project it started with a base of test.js files. Classes were then created based off of the test file guidelines and were expanded upon until all test passed. This application emphasizes the uses of classes and extended classes.
